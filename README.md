Howdy my name is Rowland Ramos and this project is to build a graphical user interface (GUI) for an aquaponics environment. Specifically I created an feeding algorithm for prawn during school and would like to now optimize it by building a GUI and create different algorithms for different aquaculture. This is all to provide a solution for sustainable food solutions across the world no matter what aquaponic environment you have.
